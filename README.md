# AI Art Museum
 
Created an Aritificial intelligence art museum using Stable diffusion in my ARTS 204 Class.

I leveraged many different prompt making skills throughout this process. I thne took the art and placed it into a unity art museum asset and deployed it to the quest 2.

This file is fully capable of being deployed to the quest 2.

There is music, simple XR Interctions and ambient noise. The purpose of this museum was to adhere to project guidelines and create art with text, while also going above and beyond and stretching my skills creatively within the medium to which I am accustomed. Digital games and experiences. This is free to download and has very few dependencies.
